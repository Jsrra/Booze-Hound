# Project 1 - Booze Hound

## Description

This responsive web application allows users to search for breweries/bars in a specified city. Bars that users have previously looked up will be saved in their local storage for future reference.

## User Story

- AS A person that wants to easily discover new bars in any given location,
- I WANT to be able to enter a city into a search field to surface information about the bars located in that city such as the name, address, and website,
- SO THAT I can make better informed decisions when ultimately deciding which establishment to patronize.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a dashboard with a search field
- WHEN I enter a city
- THEN the bars/breweries of that city will be displayed on the map as individual markers
- WHEN I click on a specific bar
- THEN its key information such as the address, phone number, website link will be shown
- THEN that bar, along with any other bars that were previously clicked on, will be stored in client-side storage as persistent data.

## Usage **TO DO**
